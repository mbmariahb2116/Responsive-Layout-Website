#Responsive-Layout Website

In this project I've built a responsive, mobile-first layout using HTML and CSS. Utilizing my understanding of responsive design I am able to adjust a websites layout to accommodate for small, medium, and large screen sizes.

I began the project by creating the CSS stylesheet to style the page for a small mobile device first. Then, using min-width media queries, I added breakpoints to adjust the layout for wider tablet and desktop screens.
